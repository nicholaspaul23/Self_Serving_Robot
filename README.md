# Self Serving Robot

This robot can feed humans hands-free. It makes use of an Arduino microcontroller and a heat detection/servo control circuit that I built to lift and rotate the robotâ€™s spoon lever, grab food, use thermistor to detect its temperature, if it is hot then turn on the fan module to cool it off and serve the food to the user.
